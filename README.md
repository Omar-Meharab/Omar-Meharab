### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**Omar-Meharab/Omar-Meharab** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in web development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to solve JavaScript problems.
- ğŸ“« You can send mail to me at: omarmeharab81@gmail.com 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Fun, Friendly, Enthusiastic and Over the top Optimist(You can't easily make me sad).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like watching coding memes sometimes to remind me that I am not alone in the universe of handling errors.
